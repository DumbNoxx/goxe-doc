## Improvements in Goxe
This version focuses on operational efficiency. We have implemented performance enhancements that allow Goxe to process logs faster, optimizing its behavior in high-load scenarios. Additionally, several community-reported bugs have been resolved, and new features have been integrated to improve the overall user experience.

## Highlighted Changes

- **Memory and Speed Optimization**: Log processing has been migrated from strings to byte slices. This change slightly reduces memory consumption and significantly accelerates data processing speed.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved an issue with the GitHub API integration. Update detection now works correctly, and update notifications are accurately triggered every hour.
- **Hot Updates (Unix)**: Introducing the `goxe update` command. You can now update to the latest version from an external terminal without stopping the main Goxe process.
    > **Technical Note:** Goxe will continue to receive and process data during the transition; received data is flushed when the switch occurs, and the new version takes control immediately. This feature is exclusive to Unix/Linux systems. For Windows, updates must be performed manually from the releases page.
