Now that the binary is installed, it’s time to configure Goxe.  
In this section, we’ll guide you through the steps required to make Goxe start processing your logs and reduce data noise.

## Config.json
### Basic configuration
Goxe generates its configuration file in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/goxe</code>, which depending on your operating system may be <code>\~/.config/goxe</code>, <code>~/Library/Application Support/goxe</code>,
or <code>%APPDATA%\goxe</code>.
<br />
The Goxe configuration file is a JSON file that defines how Goxe behaves. Below is a basic example of a `config.json` file:

```json title="config.json"
{
  "port": 1729,
  "idLog": "hostname",
  "pattenersWords": [],
  "generateLogsOptions": {
    "generateLogsFile": false,
    "hour": "00:00:00"
  },
  "webhookUrls": [],
  "bursDetectionOptions": {
    "limitBreak": 10 
  },
  "shipper": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1:5045",
    "flushInterval": 30,
    "protocol": "tcp"
  }
}
```

### Field explanation
- `port`: The port on which Goxe listens to receive logs.
- `idLog`: The field used to identify logs, commonly set to the hostname or service name.
- `pattenersWords`: A list of words ignored by Goxe while processing logs. This is useful for filtering out common noise that adds no value to summaries.
- `generateLogsOptions`: Options related to log file generation, such as whether Goxe should generate log files and at what time.
- `webhookUrls`: A list of webhooks to which Goxe sends alerts when a data burst is detected (currently supports Slack and Discord).
- `bursDetectionOptions`: Options for detecting log spikes, such as the repeated entry threshold before considering it a burst.
- `shipper`: Configuration for shipping processed logs to a specific destination, including address, flush interval, and protocol.

### Customization
You can customize each of these fields based on your specific needs.  
For example, if you want Goxe to ignore certain common words in your logs, you can add them to the `pattenersWords` list.  
If you want Goxe to send alerts to a Slack channel when a log burst is detected,
you can add the Slack webhook URL to the `webhookUrls` list.

<br />
Once you’ve configured your `config.json`, you can start Goxe and it will begin processing your logs based on the rules you’ve defined.  
Goxe supports hot reload, so any changes made to the configuration file are applied immediately without restarting the service.

## Log file generation
When Goxe starts for the first time, it creates a directory in <code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/goxe</code> (depending on your operating system, this may be <code>\~/.cache/goxe</code>, <code>~/Library/Caches/goxe</code>
or <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\goxe\Cache</code>) where generated log files are stored.  
This ensures that log files are not lost when enabling the <code>"generateLogsFile"</code> option in the configuration.

<br />
Goxe proactively creates this directory with the required permissions so performance is not impacted once the service is running.

<br />
Log files are generated in the cache directory as a backup of daily logs. These files are removed during system cleanups; since they live in the cache directory,
there’s no need to worry about long-term storage (especially given their reduced size due to log aggregation),
as the operating system manages disk space efficiently. Likewise, if this option is disabled in the configuration file,
no log files will be generated.

<Aside>
Keep in mind that `generateLogsOptions.hour` uses the server’s local time where Goxe is running.  If your server is in a different time zone, log files may be generated at a different time than expected.

At this point, Goxe is fully configured and ready to process your system logs.  
In the next section, we’ll walk you through how to send logs to Goxe so it can start reducing noise and generating intelligent summaries.
