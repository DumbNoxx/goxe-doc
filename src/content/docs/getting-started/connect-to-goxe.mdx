Once goxe is configured, the next step is to connect your applications or services so they can send logs to it.

By default, goxe listens on udp port 1729. this can be changed in the `config.json` file if needed. make sure that all applications sending logs are configured to use the same port.

## Configuring applications to send logs to goxe

Below are examples of how to configure common applications and services to send logs to goxe.

### Syslog (Linux)

If you are using syslog on a linux system, add the following line to your syslog configuration file (for example, `/etc/rsyslog.conf`):

```plaintext title="rsyslog.conf"
*.* @localhost:1729;RSYSLOG_SyslogProtocol23Format
```

After applying the change, restart the syslog service:

```bash title="terminal"
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
```

### Windows event log

On windows, you can use `nxlog` to forward event logs to goxe. below is an example configuration:

```plaintext title="nxlog.conf"
<Input in>
    Module im_msvistalog
</Input>

<Output out>
    Module om_udp
    Host localhost
    Port 1729
</Output>

<Route 1>
    Path in => out
</Route>
```

Restart the nxlog service to apply the configuration:

```cmd title="Command Prompt"
net stop nxlog
net start nxlog
```

### Syslog (MacOS)

On macos, syslog uses a similar configuration file to linux, but the service is managed with `launchctl`. add the following line to `/etc/syslog.conf`:

```plaintext title="syslog.conf"
*.* @localhost:1729
```

Restart the syslog service:

```bash title="Terminal"
sudo launchctl stop com.apple.syslogd
sudo launchctl start com.apple.syslogd
```

### Nginx

To send nginx logs to goxe, use the built-in syslog support. add the following lines to your nginx configuration file (for example, `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`):

```plaintext
error_log syslog:server=localhost:1729;
access_log syslog:server=localhost:1729 combined;
```

Restart nginx to apply the changes:

```bash title="Terminal"
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Custom Applications

Custom applications can send logs to goxe using udp.

    Example using python:
    ```python title="main.py"
    import socket

    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    log_message = "test log message"
    sock.sendto(log_message.encode(), ("localhost", 1729))
    ```

  <TabItem label="Node.js example" icon="node">
    Example using node.js:
    ```javascript title="main.js"
    const dgram = require('dgram');
    const message = Buffer.from('test log message');
    const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');

    client.send(message, 1729, 'localhost', () => {
      client.close();
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Go example" icon="seti:go">
    Example using go:
    ```go title="main.go"
    package main

    import (
        "log"
        "net"
    )

    func main() {
        conn, err := net.Dial("udp", "localhost:1729")
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
        defer conn.Close()

        logMessage := "test log message"
        _, err = conn.Write([]byte(logMessage))
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>

  Regardless of the application or service used, goxe will process any logs it receives according to the rules defined in `config.json`.

  Goxe does not provide immediate feedback when logs are received. it is designed to run silently and avoid terminal noise. if goxe is running and logs are being sent correctly, it is operating as expected.

  <Aside>
    Goxe currently does not expose a direct way to confirm log ingestion in real time. This is intentional to keep the runtime quiet.
    a future release will include a built-in way to verify incoming logs. for now, the recommended way to confirm ingestion is to inspect the output log files generated by goxe, if file logging is enabled in your configuration.
