Goxe is a log reduction tool written in go. it normalizes, 
filters, and aggregates repeated messages. the result is less noise, 
lower bandwidth, and cheaper storage without losing visibility into recurring issues.

      <TabItem label='Arch Linux/Manjaro'>
      <p>In the case of Arch Linux you have two options temporarily</p>
      <p>As with Ubuntu, Goxe isn't in the official repositories, but it is in the AUR.</p>
        <Steps>
      1. Choose the helper you use.
          <Tabs>
          <TabItem label='yay'>
            ```bash title="Arch Shell"
            yay -S goxe
            ```
          </TabItem>
           <TabItem label='paru'>
            ```bash title="Arch Shell"
            paru -S goxe
            ```
          </TabItem>
          <TabItem label='AUR (Pre-built)'>
          <p>Goxe also has its pre-compiled binary in the AUR, so you can install it with paru or yay.</p>
            ```bash title="Arch Shell"
            yay -S goxe-bin
            ```
            <Aside>
              If you use this version, remember to replace <code>goxe</code> with <code>goxe-bin</code> in the following steps.
              Also, keep in mind that this version is already pre-compiled, so it will skip the build process entirely.
            </Aside>
          </TabItem>
          </Tabs>
      2. Confirm the installation.
          <p>
            Your AUR helper will automatically download the source code and compile it. 
            Since <strong>Goxe</strong> has no external dependencies, the process is 
            clean and fast. Simply press <code>Enter</code> when prompted for 
            installation confirmations.
          </p>
      3. Verify the installation:
          ```bash title="Arch Shell"
          goxe -v
          # v1.1.2 
          ```
          The latest version should be displayed.
      4. Run goxe
          ```bash title="Arch Shell"
          goxe
          # Server listening on port: 1729
          ```
