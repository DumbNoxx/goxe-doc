### Remote Shipping

The **Remote Shipping** module is responsible for transmitting processed log aggregates from Goxe to external collectors. This functionality allows you to centralize telemetry in third-party infrastructures efficiently.

#### Operational Workflow

When the shipping function is triggered, Goxe performs the following procedure:

1. **Validation**: Checks if an address is configured in `shipper.address`.
2. **Connection**: Establishes a network connection using the defined protocol (TCP/UDP) and timeout.
3. **Processing by Origin**: Iterates through each data source (`origin`).
4. **Serialization**: Transforms counters and messages into individual JSON structures.
5. **Transmission**: Writes the data directly to the connection stream.

#### Shipper Configuration

To enable this feature, edit the `shipper` section in your configuration file:

```
shipper:
  protocol: "tcp"           # Network protocol (e.g., tcp, udp)
  address: "127.0.0.1:8080" # Remote server address
  flushInterval: 5          # Connection timeout (seconds)
```

#### Payload Structure (JSON)

Goxe sends one JSON object for each detected origin. The structure follows the defined data model to ensure compatibility with the receiver:

```json title="payload.json"
{
  "origin": "server-name",
  "data": [
    {
      "count": 10,
      "firstSeen": "2024-03-20T10:00:00Z",
      "lastSeen": "2024-03-20T10:05:00Z",
      "message": "Processed log message"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Field Specification

* **origin**: Unique identifier of the log source (e.g., filename or service).
* **data**: Collection of events detected for that specific origin.
* **count**: Number of times the message was repeated in the current interval.
* **firstSeen / lastSeen**: Timestamps indicating the event's activity window.
* **message**: The full content of the log or the identified pattern.

> **Important:** The connection is automatically closed once all origins have been processed and sent. If the remote server does not respond or the write operation fails, Goxe will return a connection error that can be reviewed in the system's internal logs.
